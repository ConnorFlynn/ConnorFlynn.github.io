Hi, my name is Connor Flynn. I am currently a Data Scientist for Chaminade University of Honolulu and the [United Nations CIFAL Honolulu Centre](https://chaminade.edu/cifal-honolulu/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwv7O0BhDwARIsAC0sjWMQ3KlX4aBp8SSrU--Pjbe7oQ98v0SnTk9P-Cof2BNAP6df3JeG-fcaAvUiEALw_wcB). I am also the Education Director for the [NSF INCLUDES Supporting Pacific Impact through Computational Excellence (SPICE Alliance)](https://www.nsfspicealliance.org/). In these exciting roles, I have the privilege of teaching and applying data science to environmental and social challenges.
